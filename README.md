## Multi-Player Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic game typically played by two players on a 3x3 grid. However, this version introduces the exciting twist of multiple players.

## Description

In this multi-player version of Tic-tac-toe, 
players take turns marking empty cells with their chosen symbols.
Each player can select their own unique character as a symbol. 
The objective remains the same: to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your symbols before your opponent does.

Notably, in this version, there's an additional winning 
conditionâ€”forming a line on all four sides of the NXN grid, providing players with an alternative strategy to secure victory.

## Features

- Multi-player support: Enjoy Tic-tac-toe with more than two players.
- Customizable symbols: Players can choose their own characters as symbols.
- Expanded winning conditions: Achieve victory by forming lines on all four sides in addition to the traditional conditions.
